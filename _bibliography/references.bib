  abstract = {v3.0: The "handle numbers better" release ~ Previously, wordfreq would group all digit sequences of the same 'shape', with length 2 or more, into a single token and return the frequency of that token, which would be a vast overestimate. Now it distributes the frequency over all numbers of that shape, with an estimated distribution that allows for Benford's law (lower numbers are more frequent) and a special frequency distribution for 4-digit numbers that look like years (2010 is more frequent than 1020). More changes related to digits: 	 	 Functions such as iter\_wordlist and top\_n\_list no longer return 	multi-digit numbers (they used to return them in their "smashed" form, such 	as "0000"). 	 	 	 lossy\_tokenize no longer replaces digit sequences with 0s. That happens 	instead in a place that's internal to the word\_frequency function, so we can 	look at the values of the digits before they're replaced. 	 Other changes: 	 	 wordfreq is now developed using poetry as its package manager, and with 	pyproject.toml as the source of configuration instead of setup.py. 	 	 	 The minimum version of Python supported is 3.7. 	 	 	 Type information is exported using py.typed.},

Unlike previous Wiktionary extractions, the new extractor, Wiktextract, fully interprets and expands templates and Lua modules in Wiktionary. This enables it to perform a more complete, robust, and maintainable extraction. The extracted data is multilingual and includes lemmas, inflected forms, translations, etymology, usage examples, pronunciations (including URLs of sound files), lexical and semantic relations, and various morphological, syntactic, semantic, topical, and dialectal annotations. We extract all data from the English Wiktionary. Comparing against previous extractions from language-specific dictionaries, we find that its coverage for non-English languages often matches or exceeds the coverage in the language-specific editions, with the added benefit that all glosses are in English. The data is freely available and regularly updated, enabling anyone to add more data and correct errors by editing Wiktionary. The extracted data is in JSON format and designed to be easy to use by researchers, downstream resources, and application developers.},
