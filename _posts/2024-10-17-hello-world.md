Hello World! This is the first post on this blog, and I want to use it to capture my current state of mind for my future self. If you are reading this future me, then welcome back!

Currently, I am working on my masterâ€™s thesis on Explainable AI. Due to the black box nature of deep learning models and the uncertainty of getting results, it's making me a bit anxious. Pretty stressful with work on the side. But it's going, and I have 24 weeks left at this point. Hopefully all goes well!

Now for the reason I started this blog: I created some tools for Vietnamese language learning and wanted to publish my results. Could be of use to someone else! I already created a post, see its [project page](/projects/vietnamese-language-tools/).

I am having a lot of fun learning Vietnamese. The feeling of learning new vocabulary and _finally_ understanding some headlines after all these years feels great! Future-me, you're still having a go at it, [I hope](/assets/img/blog/other/duo_laser.png)?

What's also been lately on my mind is "futuristic" sounding music, and I can't get enough of it. Ever since aespa released their new album's title track [Whiplash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWQx2f-CErU) I have been obsessed. The bass, the crunchy synths, and the drop at 2:46, where the minimalistic soundscape opens up, sound absolutely sick.

This song made me create a new playlist called "Club Mix 30XX" (meaning in the year 3000-something). While looking for songs, I rediscovered the TRON: Legacy soundtrack. After all these years, it still sounds incredible to me and still very futuristic! I remember I listened to it when it came out, but there is actually a "complete" edition with more tracks. I wasn't aware of the track "Castor" before, but it fits perfectly into the playlist.

Anyway, enough rambling. I need to go to sleep. Perhaps see you in a year or so?
