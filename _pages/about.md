Hi there and welcome to my page!

My name is Trung Đức Hà (also known as Devin at work) and I am a masters student in Computer Science at TU Berlin. I am currently writing my masters thesis in Explainable Artifical Intelligence (XAI) with the [Machine Learning Group at TU Berlin](https://web.ml.tu-berlin.de/). I am also currently employed part-time as a Software/Machine Learning Engineer at John Snow Labs working on the open source library [Spark NLP](https://sparknlp.org/).

Outside of work and school, I like to build stuff (whether software or with my hands), learn Vietnamese, play electric guitar/produce music (currently on hold) and if time allows play video games.

I want to use this page to describe some of my personal projects that I am doing and let out my thoughts from time to time. Currently, I have a lot of fun building tools to enhance my Vietnamese learning. Check it out in my [Projects page](/projects).

Hopefully my posts will be of use to someone else.

Enjoy your stay!
