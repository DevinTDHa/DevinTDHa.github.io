Hi there and welcome to my website!

My name is Trung Đức Hà (also known as Devin at work). I recently finished my master's thesis in Explainable Artificial Intelligence with the [Machine Learning Group at TU Berlin](https://web.ml.tu-berlin.de/) and am currently employed as a Software/Machine Learning Engineer at John Snow Labs, working on the open source library [Spark NLP](https://sparknlp.org/).

I am a nerd interested in all manner of things. This includes science, nature, music theory/production, films and philosophy. In my free time, I like to build stuff (whether software or with my hands), learn Vietnamese, play electric guitar/produce music and play video games.

I want to use this website to describe some of my personal projects that I am doing and let out my thoughts from time to time. Currently, I have a lot of fun building tools to enhance my Vietnamese learning. You can check it out on my [Projects page](/projects). Hopefully my posts could be useful for other people (like you!) as well.

Enjoy your stay!
